# Analysis of UK Road Safety Data using Time Series models

This repository includes analysis on road traffic accidents occurring in the UK in 2018. The research data includes records of accidents per hour, road surface conditions, precipitations, road lighting conditions and type of area.


The data can be found on the [Department of Transport website](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-accidents-and-safety-statistics)


**Time Series Analysis and Modelling using ARIMA**
The purpose of the analysis is to help a road assistance company efficiently allocate their resources to meet demand on an hourly basis. 
The analysis will involve analysing the hourly number of accidents over the course of 2018 to find trends in the number of accidents around a specific hour of the day. This will then give insight into what could be expected when the time series forecast models.
